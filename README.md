# Investigate No Show Appointments Dataset
## Project Aim:
Investigate and analyze the dataset to determine the main characteristics associated with showing up in the appointment and vise versa. And hopefully this could help us predict weather a patient is more likely to show up for his appointment or not?

## Dataset preview:
`No show appointments` dataset contains information about 110,527 medical appointments and their 14 associated characteristics. The most important one is weather the patient showed up for his appointment or not.

The characteristics associated with each appointment record are:

1. Patient Id: identification of a patient
2. Appointment ID: identification of each appointment
3. Gender: Male or Female.
4. Scheduled Day: the day of the actual appointment.
5. Appointment Day: the day someone called or registered the appointment.
6. Age: How old is the patient?
7. Neighborhood: the place of the appointment.
8. Bolsa Família enrollment status: whether the patient is enrolled in the Bolsa Família program or not.
9. Hypertension: whether the patient has hypertension or not.
10. Diabetes: whether the patient has diabetes or not
11. Alcoholism: whether the patient is alcoholic or not
12. Handicap: whether the patient is handicapped or not
13. SMS_received: 1 or more messages sent to the patient.
14. show up status: whether the patient showed up for his appointment or not.

## Questions:
The following questions are aimed to be answered by the outcome of the analysis:

- What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
- do the Bolsa Família program associates seem to have better commitment than those who are not part of it?
- is having a certain disease associated with better commitment?
- what gender is associated with better commitment?
- does the number of SMS sent to the patient increases the probability of him showing up in his appointment?
- is there association between duration between scheduled date and appointment date and the commitment of the patient?
